# What is nacOS?
nacOS is a side project that I always wanted to create. Creating an operating system from scratch is not really that easy for a solo developer. Making this in Python would be the easiest option. Of course one day, I would love to port this into an iso and actually make an operating system.

# Develop for nacOS
Docs about how to develop for nacOS will be added soon as a wiki.
